# Project

`Tomatenquark` describes itself as _"a community homage to Cube 2: Sauerbraten"_.

The primary objective of `Tomatenquark` is to bring back ongoing development of the game and its [amazing community](http://sauerworld.org/). 

The project is a friendly fork of Sauerbraten. Changes to the [SVN](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/sauerbraten/code) will be incorporated into `Tomatenquark` in the foreseeable future.

### Additional installation instructions for Linux

Please note that the game is built for, and tested only on Ubuntu, hence these instructions are for Ubuntu distributions.
It may work on other distributions as well, but we give no guarantees.

The game may not run out of the box on Ubuntu due to missing dependencies.
This can be fixed by installing the missing dependencies via `apt`.

```
sudo apt install libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libcurl4
```
