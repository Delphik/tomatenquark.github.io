# Mapping standards

If you would like to submit your map for inclusion in the game please make sure it ticks off the following list:

- [ ] mapname in lower case
- [ ] maptitle with authorâ€™s name
- [ ] mapname.txt file with additional credits and [license](/media/LICENSING)
- [ ] fully lit & calclighted map (no fullbright maps)
- [ ] no more than about 200 wtr (polygons) (for performance)
- [ ] team and ffa spawns for all maps except duel maps (duel maps dont need ctf spawns)
- [ ] bot paths (.wpt waypoint file)
- [ ] a square map thumbnail/loading pic (.jpg)

Please note that these guidelines are subject to change by the Tomatenquark team.
