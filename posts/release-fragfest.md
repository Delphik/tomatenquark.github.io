# Release & Fragfest

Dear Tomatoes,

after a fair amount of delay we are pleased to announce that Tomatenquark will be released to the general public on March 24th. This release also includes the hide & seek mode, alongside many, many other improvements.

To celebrate this milestone we would like to invite you all!
There will be a Q&A session held on [Discord](https://discord.gg/47rkQar) at 5PM CET. This Q&A is your chance to get to chat with the developers.

Subsequent to the Q&A session the frag fest will start at 5:30PM CET. We will play with our friends and foes on different maps and modes. Come and join us, it's gonna be fun!

## Call for web developers / designers

We're looking to revamp the start page of Tomatenquark. If you know something about web design or development, please reach out to us. We'd be delighted to make this space even better for new and old players alike.

## Near future

> Q: So, with the official Steam release out of the way, can you share what will be the next steps for Tomatenquark?

Yes, sure, we've compiled a list of frequently requested features, sorted by priority:

1. Steam integration, including VAC and Steam Workshop
2. Racing game mode
3. A new and exciting campaign with voice acting
4. More maps and content out of the box (see 1.)
5. More statistics in game and global statistics

If you're delighted about these improvements, stay tuned to get them shipped to you in the next weeks.
Keep fragging!
