# What is Tomatenquark

`Tomatenquark` is a early stage project dedicated to the [Cube 2: Sauerbraten](http://sauerbraten.org/) game.
It was born out of frustration about the ongoing stagnation of development effort into `sauerbraten`.

`Tomatenquark`'s primary objective is to bring back ongoing development of the game and it's [amazing community](http://sauerworld.org/). This effort will be initiated by providing binaries of the current [svn](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/sauerbraten/code). Changes to the current `svn` will be incorporated into `Tomatenquark` in the foreseeable future.

The current release binaries can be downloaded via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Tomatenquark/code/releases) (built by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)) below.

If you would like to contribute to the ongoing development of `Tomatenquark` (and thus the `sauerbraten` ecosystem) please note the following:

- there is a overall direction that this project aims at - see ["Sauerbraten fork - Tomatenquark"](https://hackmd.io/@VEZp3E0FRz-R7QeOzCh6zg/SkC5zPeGU)
- the project is in very early phases. Feedback is highly appreciated. You can talk to me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/012c19bkwljlWsh3y).
- everything is undocumented right now. This is very much how `sauerbraten` deals with things, and very much how `Tomatenquark` **is not supposed** to be. Be a little patient. Creating quality documentation takes time üç∑
